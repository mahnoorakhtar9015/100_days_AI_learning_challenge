# 100_days_AI_learning_challenge

Welcome to my 100-day learning challenge, where I embark on a journey to master Artificial Intelligence (AI) from the ground up! Over the next 100 days, I will dive deep into the fundamentals of AI, covering everything from basic concepts to advanced techniques. This challenge will encompass a wide range of topics, including AI algorithms, machine learning, deep learning, and natural language processing.

My learning path will also involve developing a solid understanding of backend and frontend development, building and integrating APIs, and scraping data to create dynamic AI-powered applications. By the end of this challenge, I aim to have a comprehensive understanding of AI, along with hands-on experience in developing end-to-end AI solutions that combine data science and API integration.

Join me on this exciting journey as I document my progress, share resources, and build projects to demonstrate my learning every step of the way!
